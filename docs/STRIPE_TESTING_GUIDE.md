## Test Scenarios

### 1. Pricing Page & Checkout Flow

**Steps:**
1. Navigate to `/pricing` (or click "Upgrade" in account settings)
2. Verify all 4 tiers are displayed:
   - Free: $0/month
   - Author: $9/month or $100/year
   - Professional: $29/month or $300/year
   - Team: $99/month or $1,000/year
3. Toggle between Monthly and Annual billing
   - Verify "Save 17%" badge appears for annual plans
4. Click "Get Started" on Author plan

### 2. AI Generation Limits

**Free Tier Limits:**
1. As a free user, go to Character Generator
2. Verify usage indicator shows "X/20 AI generations today"
3. Generate 20 characters
4. On the 21st attempt, verify:
   - UpgradePrompt dialog appears
   - Generation is blocked
   - Dialog shows upgrade options

**Paid Tier Unlimited:**
1. Upgrade to Author plan (using test card)
2. Go to Character Generator
3. Verify usage indicator shows "Unlimited AI generations"
4. Generate multiple characters (no limit)

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Free users hit limit at 20 generations
- ✅ Paid users have unlimited generations
- ✅ Usage indicator shows correct count and limit

### 3. Billing Management

**View Subscription:**
1. Navigate to Account Settings → Billing
2. Verify displayed information:
   - Current plan name (e.g., "Author Plan")
   - Billing period (Monthly/Annual)
   - Next billing date
   - Trial status (if applicable)
   - Payment method

**Manage Subscription via Customer Portal:**
1. Click "Manage Billing" button
2. Verify redirected to Stripe Customer Portal
3. In portal, test:
   - Update payment method
   - View invoice history
   - Change plan (upgrade/downgrade)
   - Cancel subscription

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ All subscription details displayed correctly
- ✅ Customer portal accessible and functional
- ✅ Changes in portal sync to app

### 4. Subscription Lifecycle

**Trial Period:**
1. Subscribe to any paid plan
2. Verify trial status in billing settings
3. Check database: `trial_end_date` set correctly
4. Access paid features during trial

**Active Subscription:**
1. Wait for trial to end (or manually update in Stripe)
2. Verify subscription becomes "active"
3. Ensure features remain accessible
4. Check invoice created and payment processed

**Cancellation:**
1. In Customer Portal or via API, cancel subscription
2. Verify:
   - Subscription marked for cancellation
   - Access continues until period end
   - "Cancel Subscription" button disabled
   - "Reactivate Subscription" button appears

**Reactivation:**
1. After canceling, click "Reactivate Subscription"
2. Verify:
   - Subscription reactivated in Stripe
   - Access continues
   - Cancellation notice removed

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Trial → Active transition works
- ✅ Cancellation scheduled correctly
- ✅ Reactivation restores subscription
- ✅ Access controlled properly throughout lifecycle

### 5. Webhook Events

**Test webhook delivery:**
1. Use Stripe CLI: `stripe listen --forward-to localhost:5000/api/stripe/webhook`
2. Trigger events:
   ```bash
   stripe trigger checkout.session.completed
   stripe trigger customer.subscription.updated
   stripe trigger customer.subscription.deleted
   stripe trigger invoice.payment_failed
   ```
3. Verify in logs:
   - Webhook signature verified
   - Event processed correctly
   - Database updated

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ All webhook events processed successfully
- ✅ Subscription status updated in database
- ✅ User tier changes reflected immediately

### 6. Payment Failures

**Declined Card:**
1. Start checkout with declined card (4000 0000 0000 0002)
2. Verify error message displayed
3. Ensure no subscription created

**Insufficient Funds:**
1. Use card 4000 0000 0000 9995
2. Verify appropriate error handling

**3D Secure:**
1. Use card 4000 0025 0000 3155
2. Complete 3D Secure challenge
3. Verify payment succeeds after authentication

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Error messages clear and helpful
- ✅ Failed payments don't create subscriptions
- ✅ 3D Secure flow works correctly

### 7. Edge Cases

**Upgrade Between Tiers:**
1. Subscribe to Author plan
2. Upgrade to Professional plan
3. Verify:
   - Prorated credit applied
   - New tier features accessible
   - Billing updated correctly

**Downgrade:**
1. Subscribe to Professional plan
2. Downgrade to Author plan
3. Verify:
   - Change scheduled for period end
   - Access to Professional features continues until then
   - Downgrade completes at period end

**Multiple Sessions:**
1. Start checkout but don't complete
2. Start another checkout
3. Complete second checkout
4. Verify only one subscription created

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Prorated upgrades work correctly
- ✅ Downgrades scheduled properly
- ✅ No duplicate subscriptions

## Monitoring & Debugging

### Check Logs
- View server logs for webhook events
- Check Stripe Dashboard → Developers → Logs
- Monitor database for subscription updates

### Database Queries
```sql
-- Check user subscription
SELECT * FROM user_subscriptions WHERE user_id = 'USER_ID';

-- Check AI usage
SELECT * FROM ai_usage_logs WHERE user_id = 'USER_ID' ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- Check daily usage summary
SELECT * FROM ai_usage_daily_summary WHERE user_id = 'USER_ID';
```

### Stripe Dashboard
- Test mode subscriptions: Subscriptions → All subscriptions
- Webhook logs: Developers → Webhooks → [your webhook] → Events
- Test clocks: Developers → Test clocks (for time-based testing)

## Common Issues

### Issue: Webhook not received
**Solution:**
- Check webhook endpoint URL in Stripe Dashboard
- Verify webhook signing secret matches
- Use Stripe CLI to test locally

### Issue: Subscription not updating
**Solution:**
- Check webhook event logs
- Verify database connection
- Check server logs for errors

### Issue: Payment fails silently
**Solution:**
- Check Stripe Dashboard for error details
- Verify API keys are correct
- Check browser console for frontend errors

### Issue: Usage limits not enforced
**Solution:**
- Verify 'ai_generations' key used consistently
- Check subscription tier limits in code
- Verify usage tracking working

## Success Criteria

Before considering testing complete, verify:
- ✅ All 4 subscription tiers functional
- ✅ Checkout flow works for monthly and annual plans
- ✅ Trials start correctly (14 days)
- ✅ AI generation limits enforced (20/day free, unlimited paid)
