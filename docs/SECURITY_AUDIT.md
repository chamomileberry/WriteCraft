  - Session expiration: 30 days
- **Future Enhancement:** Redis migration for multi-instance support

### 8. Security Headers

- **Headers:**
  - `Strict-Transport-Security`: Forces HTTPS (1 year)
  - `X-Content-Type-Options`: Prevents MIME sniffing

  - Stored as salted hashes only
  - No plaintext storage
  - Secure comparison to prevent timing attacks

## üìä Dependency Security

### NPM Audit Results
**Last Scan:** October 16, 2025

**Vulnerabilities Found:** 2 moderate severity
- **Package:** esbuild (via vite)
- **Issue:** Development server vulnerability (GHSA-67mh-4wv8-2f99)
- **Impact:** Development only - does not affect production
- **Mitigation:** 
  - Production builds use static assets served by Express
  - No esbuild dev server exposed in production
  - Recommended: Update to Vite 7.x when stable

**Production Impact:** ‚úÖ None (development-only vulnerability)

### Recommended Actions
1. Monitor for Vite 7.x stable release
2. Test breaking changes before upgrading
3. Run `npm audit` weekly in CI/CD pipeline
4. Consider Snyk or Dependabot for automated alerts

## üîê Secrets Management

### Current Secrets Inventory
| Secret | Purpose | Rotation | Storage |
|--------|---------|----------|---------|
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | AI service auth | 90 days | Replit Secrets |
| `MFA_ENCRYPTION_KEY` | MFA data encryption | 90 days | Replit Secrets |
| `SESSION_SECRET` | Session signing | 90 days | Replit Secrets |
| `DATABASE_URL` | Database connection | Manual | Replit Secrets |
| `REDIS_URL` | Cache connection | Manual | Replit Secrets |

### Secrets Best Practices
- ‚úÖ Never commit secrets to git
- ‚úÖ All secrets stored in Replit Secrets (encrypted at rest)
- ‚úÖ Automated rotation tracking for critical keys
- ‚úÖ Audit logging for all secret access
- ‚úÖ Minimum privilege principle (scoped API keys)
- ‚úÖ Regular rotation reminders via email

### MFA Encryption Key Requirements
**Critical:** `MFA_ENCRYPTION_KEY` must be exactly 64 hexadecimal characters (32 bytes)
```bash
# Generate new key:
openssl rand -hex 32
```
Server will fail to start if key is invalid (intentional security measure).
