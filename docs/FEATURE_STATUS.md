# Feature Implementation Status

This document clarifies the implementation status of features that may appear as "stubs" or "not implemented" in the codebase.

## ✅ Fully Implemented Features (Mistakenly Listed as Stubs)

### Family Tree Relationships
**Status:** FULLY IMPLEMENTED  
**Location:** `server/repositories/family-tree.repository.ts` (lines 187-238)  
**Frontend Usage:** `client/src/components/FamilyTreeEditor.tsx`

The family tree relationship system is complete with full CRUD operations:
- `createFamilyTreeRelationship()` - Creates new relationships between family members
- `getFamilyTreeRelationships()` - Retrieves relationships for a tree
- `updateFamilyTreeRelationship()` - Updates existing relationships
- `deleteFamilyTreeRelationship()` - Removes relationships

**Features:**
- Ownership validation through tree access control
- Proper error handling and authorization checks
- Full integration with ReactFlow-based family tree editor
- Junction-based parent-child relationship visualization

## ❌ Not Implemented (And Not Used)

### Magic System
**Status:** NOT IMPLEMENTED  
**Reason:** No frontend demand or usage

The magic system throws "Magic system not implemented" errors in `server/repositories/storage.facade.ts` (lines 383-397). However, this is not a priority because:
- No routes exist for magic content
- No frontend components reference magic as a content type
- "Magic" is only referenced as character field options (e.g., "magical abilities")
- Would require: schema definition, routes, repository, and UI components

**If needed in future:**
1. Define schema in `shared/schema.ts`
2. Create magic repository in `server/repositories/`
3. Add routes in `server/routes/magic.routes.ts`
4. Build UI components for magic content management

### Project Links
**Status:** NOT IMPLEMENTED  
**Reason:** No frontend demand or usage

Project link functionality is commented out with TODO markers in `server/repositories/content.repository.ts`. Not implemented because:
- No frontend code references project links
- No user stories or requirements for cross-project linking
- Current project system doesn't need explicit link types

**If needed in future:**
1. Define link types and schema
2. Uncomment and complete repository methods
3. Add linking UI to project management pages

## Summary

| Feature | Implementation Status | Frontend Usage | Priority |
|---------|---------------------|----------------|----------|
| Family Tree Relationships | ✅ Fully Implemented | ✅ Actively Used | N/A (Complete) |
| Magic System | ❌ Not Implemented | ❌ Not Used | Low (No demand) |
| Project Links | ❌ Not Implemented | ❌ Not Used | Low (No demand) |

## Recommendations

1. **Family Tree Relationships:** Continue using as-is, already production-ready
2. **Magic System:** Only implement if user stories emerge requiring magic as a distinct content type
3. **Project Links:** Only implement if cross-project navigation features are requested
