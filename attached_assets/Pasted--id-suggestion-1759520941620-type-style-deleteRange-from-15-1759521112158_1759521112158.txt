    "suggestedText": "This type of culture occurs when a society cultivates some crops through farming, but still gets a significant portion of its food from the wild in terms of hunting and foraging. A village might have small, cultivated plots of land where they grow staples like maize, beans, squash, or root vegetables such as yams and taro, but they supplement their diet by hunting deer, wild boar, or smaller game in the surrounding forest, fishing in the local river for salmon, trout, or other freshwater species, and gathering wild plants including berries, nuts, mushrooms, edible roots, and medicinal herbs. The cultivation efforts are often seasonal and relatively modest in scale, with families or extended kinship groups maintaining gardens near their dwellings rather than establishing expansive agricultural fields. The hunting and gathering activities may actually provide more calories and nutritional diversity than the cultivated crops, particularly during certain times of the year when wild resources are abundant. These cultures tend to emerge in heavily forested or coastal areas where natural resources remain plentiful enough to sustain regular harvesting, where the environment offers rich biodiversity that can be exploited without complete reliance on agriculture, and where the terrain or climate may not be ideally suited to intensive farming practices that would allow full sedentary agricultural lifestyles.",
