    "physique": "[p]Juniper has faced her challenges with finding enough sustenance in the desert, but she has managed to feed herself through hunting, which has kept her slender but stronger than she looks. She still has a slight air of looking a bit thin or malnourished while still being lean and muscular. She has always had symptoms from exposure to the Verdant compound, but her condition becomes amplified by her bond with the Verdant Shard.[/p]\r\n[p][/p]\r\n[p]Juniper’s body has been forged by scarcity, desert survival, and constant movement rather than by luxury or training. She isn’t muscular in a sculpted way, but wiry, lean, and whip-strong in the way of someone who spends every day walking miles across salt flats, hauling supplies, or scrambling through ruins. Her build reflects endurance and agility over brute strength—more suited to dodging, climbing, and lasting through harsh conditions than overpowering an opponent.[/p]\r\n[p][/p]\r\n[p]She carries scars that tell her history: a scar along her forearm from a solar flare accident, and a small notch through one eyebrow from childhood misadventure. Her skin is weathered and olive-toned, toughened by sun exposure, with freckles that bloom under desert light. Her curls are sun-bleached, tangled, and often caked with dust, making her look wild and unpolished.[/p]\r\n[p][/p]\r\n[p]Juniper shows early signs of @[Spore Lung](Article:dc02e16b-3bc7-4e7b-b515-242bfae2544e), a slow affliction from Verdant spores that makes her cough in the mornings, breathe shallow, and sometimes wake with a mossy taste in her throat. Maelle notices she’s slower in the mornings and paler than she should be, though June downplays it. It’s a creeping vulnerability—her body beginning to betray her even as she’s forced into greater dangers.[/p]\r\n[p][/p]\r\n[p]She doesn’t rely on technological aids; her survival tools are simple: cracked goggles, her bone-whittled bow, patched desert clothing, and a green pendant that’s both symbol and strange protection. She moves with determination and a touch of clumsiness at times—she’s still young and not fully confident in her strength—but necessity keeps her agile and resilient. Her “fitness” is that of someone who can’t afford not to be: honed by need, marred by illness, and pushed forward by sheer willpower.[/p]\r\n[p][/p]",
    "bodyFeatures": "[p]June’s body carries the story of her environment. Her olive-toned skin is sun-bitten and dust-worn, with freckles scattered across her cheeks, shoulders, and forearms like little constellations baked in by desert light. Her skin isn’t soft—more weathered leather than silk, with a roughness that comes from years of wind, salt, and grit scraping over it. When she moves, you’d notice small scars and scratches cross-hatched over her limbs: evidence of climbing jagged stone, falling in the flats, or brushing too close to thorn and Verdant growth. Her skin carries the desert's colour palette: warm golds, browns, and red undertones. She has a slender, lean, and wiry build. She is strong but not bulky, and is shaped by necessity rather than training. Each one of her muscles is practical for climbing, running, and hauling water.  She also has a scar on her right forearm from a solar flare that caused machinery to malfunction. Her knees are scarred from her childhood of climbing, scavenging, and falling on the Salt Flats and rocky Mojave desert terrain. Her hands are calloused from always scavenging and working with rope, stone, and wood.[/p]\r\n[p][/p]\r\n[p]A few features stand out as uniquely hers:[/p]\r\n[ul]\r\n- [b]Scar on her forearm[/b] – from a solar flare accident, a pale streak against her otherwise sun-warmed skin.\r\n- [b]Eyebrow notch[/b] – a faint split in one brow from childhood, not a fighter’s mark but an accident’s, softening rather than hardening her face.\r\n- [b]Freckles & sunmarks[/b] – they deepen with each season, giving her a speckled, earthy look, almost as if she’s carrying a map of the desert sky across her skin.\r\n- [b]Hair and dust[/b] – her curls are often caked with salt, sand, or wind-blown grit, making her look untamed. Strands bleach into copper-gold streaks, catching the sun against her darker roots.\r\n- [b]Hands[/b] – calloused, with small nicks along her knuckles and palms from handling rough tools, bows, and scavenged metal. They betray a life of use, not ornament.\r\n[/ul]\r\n[p][/p]\r\n[p]There’s also a subtle [i]wrongness[/i] creeping in—early symptoms of Spore Lung. Her lips chap faster than most, her skin sometimes pales in the mornings, and there’s a faint mossy dryness in her throat that seems to echo in her complexion. It’s not obvious to outsiders, but to those who know her, she sometimes looks as if the Verdant is brushing against her from the inside out.[/p]\r\n[p][/p]\r\n[p]So while June doesn’t have anything “mutant” or spectacularly strange about her body, the distinctiveness is in how it [i]wears the desert[/i]: cracked lips, freckles, scars, and that restless tension of someone shaped by sun, salt, and survival.[/p]\r\n[p][/p]",
