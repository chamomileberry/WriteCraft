Can you please confirm whether the following tasks were completed? If they were not completed, please create a strategic implementation plan based on what still needs to be done to ensure comprehensive data security across the application. 

1. Confirm the storage-level-owned modules still reject foreign user reads. 
2. Extend equivalent ownership validation to PUT/PATCH/DELETE routes. 
3. Add automated tests covering 401/403 behaviours for representative resources. 
4. Add structured logging around ownership denial to aid intrusion detection
5. Consider unit tests covering validateContentOwnership edge cases (e.g. soft-delete or system-owned records). 
6. Keep this pattern as part of future code review checklists to prevent regression.  
7. Inventory each storage method to classify as user-owned vs public and capture in a checklist. 
8. Update storage signatures to require userId and adjust route handlers to pass it, ensuring all queries filter by ownership. 
9. Add documentation/tests confirming public endpoints and verifying 403 behaviours for cross-user access post-migration. 
10. Review each get * implementation in server/storage.ts to confirm the database-level and(eq(id), eq(userId), eq(notebookId)) filters are in place. 
11. Audit update/delete implementations to ensure they enforce notebook ownership or explicitly justify why notebook scoping is unnecessary. 
12. Once verified, document the storage-layer ownership rule as the canonical pattern and add regression test covering a sample content type to lock the behaviour in. 
13. Restore storage.getGuide signature to accept userId, filter by id & userId, and update callers accordingly. 
14. Confirm all other storage get * methods still enforce both userId and notebookId (where relevant) after changes. 
15. Re-run authorization regression test to ensure no remaining routes rely on route-level ownership checks. 
16. Ensure Automatic session expiry handling has been fixed. 
17. Rework the auth query to use getQueryFn({ on401: “returnNull” }) (or otherwise avoid self-invalidating on 401) so it resolves null without looping
18. Keep the mutation onError 401 invalidation since it already ensures the auth query refetches after expired session mutations. 
19. After adjusting the query behaviour, retest session expiry to confirm the user is redirected once and the loop is eliminated. 
20. Run manual session expiry checks (invalidate cookie, trigger query/mutation) to confirm redirect UX. 
21. Cover representative AI/upload/search flows in forthcoming integration tests to assert 401/403 handling. 
22. Monitor logs for unexpected 401 loops as tests are added to ensure no regressions. 
23. Document the public /objects/:objectPath(*) contract and monitoring  expectations. 
24. Monitor future route additions for compliance with the middleware ordering and storage ownership contract. 
25. Add Vitest + Supertest dev dependencies and create test/auth.spec.ts that spins the app with fake auth contexts and seeded data. 
26. Implement shared helpers for seeding two users’ resources and toggling auth middleware on/off. 
27. Wire the suite into CI via npm test to guard future routes against missing 401/403 checks. 
28. Run a code base-wide audit focusing on any remaining endpoints or pathways that could bypass ownership checks. 
29. Implement a minimal Vitest + Supertest suite covering representative 401 and 403 scenarios across key resource families to lock in current guarantees. 
30. Execute end-to-end authorization flow testing to confirm session handling and cross-user isolation in real usage paths. 
31. Remove the 60 legacy backup route files to eliminate future confusion. 
32. Add an npm script (e.g., “test”: “vitest”) plus any required Vitest config. 
33. Create a test helper that spins up the Express app and seeds a user/session for Supertest. 
34. Implement a minimal suite covering unahthenticated 401s, cross-user 403/404s, and a happy path 200 to validate the pipeline. 
35. Refactor the server entry point to export the Express app (without listening) and add reusable Supertest setup/seeding utilities. 
36. Replace placeholder bodies with real HTTP calls asserting 401 for unauthenticated access, 404/403 for cross-user requests, and 200 for owner flows. 
37. Add workflow/script so vitest runs cleanly (e.g., via npm run test) and ensure the suite passes end to end.
