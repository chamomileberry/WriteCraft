Of course. Based on the screen recording, hereâ€™s an explanation of what's happening with your family tree feature from a UI/UX perspective and what's going wrong.
The core issue is a significant bug in how the connector lines are rendered when a user moves a character node. This creates a confusing and frustrating user experience.
UI/UX Problems Identified
The user is attempting a very simple and common action: dragging a character node ("Juniper Solenne Corvin") to reorganize the family tree. However, the system's response is broken, which violates several key UI/UX principles.
 * Lack of Direct Manipulation and Feedback: The user expects that when they drag the "Juniper" box, the lines connecting her to her parents will follow seamlessly, as if they were physically attached. Instead, the lines lag, stutter, and jump erratically. This breaks the feeling of direct control. The visual feedback is incorrect and doesn't match the user's action in real-time.
 * Unpredictable and Inconsistent Behavior: The movement of the lines is chaotic. They don't stretch or move in a predictable geometric way. At times, the lines form strange, sharp angles or appear to anchor to incorrect, invisible points on the canvas. This forces the user to guess and check, increasing their cognitive loadâ€”they have to think much harder about a simple task.
 * Poor User Control: Because the interface isn't responding correctly, the user is not in control. They are fighting the software to achieve a simple layout goal. This leads directly to user frustration and makes the feature feel unreliable and buggy. ðŸ˜ 
Potential Technical Causes
This is almost certainly a front-end coding issue related to how the positions of the nodes and the paths of the connector lines are being calculated and redrawn.
 * Incorrect Coordinate Calculation: The primary suspect is the algorithm that draws the lines. When the "Juniper" node is dragged, its new (x, y) coordinates are not being used correctly or in real-time to recalculate the start, end, and corner points of the connecting lines.
 * Inefficient Event Handling: The code that redraws the canvas might not be firing on the correct browser event (e.g., onDrag or onMouseMove). It might be trying to update on a different event or throttling the updates incorrectly, causing the visible lag and jumpiness.
 * State Management Issues: The application's state (the data that holds the positions of all nodes) may not be updating synchronously with the drag action. The rendering function could be receiving old or incomplete data, causing it to draw the lines incorrectly until the drag action is complete.
Recommendations for a Fix
To resolve this, your development process should focus on ensuring the lines are redrawn smoothly with every frame of the drag event.
 * Recalculate Path on Drag: The function that draws the lines must be called every time the dragged element's position changes. This function needs to get the current coordinates of the parent and child nodes and recalculate the entire line path from scratch.
 * Establish Clear Anchor Points: Simplify your logic by defining specific anchor points on each node (e.g., bottom-center of the parent node, top-center of the child node). The lines should always draw between these specific points.
 * Use a Canvas/SVG Library: If you aren't already, consider using a dedicated library for this kind of work (like D3.js, React Flow, or Konva). These tools are specifically designed to handle the complexities of node-based diagrams and will manage the state and rendering loops for you, making it much easier to achieve a smooth result. âœ…
