# React Timeline - Flowbite

Use the timeline component from Flowbite React to display a list of items and events in a chronological order based on multiples styles, colors and layouts

The timeline component can be used to show a list of events and items in a chronological order with a vertical or horizontal alignment based on multiple examples, styles, layouts, and colors.

You can customize the content and options of the timeline component by using the custom React props API from Flowbite React and the utility classes from Tailwind CSS for quick style changes.

In order to use the timeline component make sure to import it first from Flowbite React:

```jsx code-highlight
import { Timeline } from "flowbite-react";

```
