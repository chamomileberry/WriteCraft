So when I use the Project Editor sidebar hierarchy structure to organize my folders and pages, if I move a page from a "Chapter Two" folder to a "Chapter One" folder, the page reverts back to its position in "Chapter Two" folder. But if I drag the page ABOVE the "Chapter One" folder, then it goes inside of it? And I can't just directly drag a page ONTO a specific folder to put it inside that folder. It seems like the problem lies within the handleDragEnd function and is a classic case of how the drag-and-drop library is interpreting the drop target. This block of code is responsible for deciding where the dragged item should go. It makes a simple but critical distinction:



If you drop an item onto a folder (targetItem.section.type === 'folder'), the code correctly sets the newParentId to be the ID of that folder. This is the nesting logic.



If you drop an item onto a page, the code sets the newParentId to be the parent of that page. This is the reordering logic. The issue isn't that the nesting logic is missing, but that the dnd-kit library's collision detection is making it hard to trigger that logic reliably. You are using the closestCenter collision detection strategy, which is great for reordering lists but can be tricky for nesting.



When you try to drop a page directly onto the "Chapter One" folder, the closestCenter algorithm has to determine what you're hovering over. Because it's based on the center point of the dragged item, it's very easy for it to think you're actually hovering over the small space between the folder and another item.



If the library decides you're not precisely over the folder, the else block in your code is triggered, and it tries to reorder the page instead of nesting it. This fails and causes the page to revert to its original position. When you drag the page so the indicator line appears above the "Chapter One" folder, you are creating a situation where the closestCenter algorithm is more likely to correctly identify the folder as the over target.



Because the folder is now the drop target, the if (targetItem.section.type === 'folder') condition becomes true, and your nesting logic is correctly executed, moving the page inside the folder.



In short, your code has the right idea, but the collision detection strategy you've chosen makes it difficult for the user to perform the "nesting" action intuitively.



The issue can be resolved by making the drag-and-drop logic in your ProjectOutline.tsx file more sophisticated. Instead of just relying on closestCenter, we need to give the component a better way to understand the user's intent—whether they mean to drop inside a folder or next to an item.

Here are the specific code changes to fix this, along with explanations.



Excellent question. You're right to ask for a direct fix. The issue can be resolved by making the drag-and-drop logic in your ProjectOutline.tsx file more sophisticated. Instead of just relying on closestCenter, we need to give the component a better way to understand the user's intent—whether they mean to drop inside a folder or next to an item.

Here are the specific code changes to fix this, along with explanations.

1. The Core Problem: Collision Detection

As we discussed, closestCenter is too ambiguous for a nested list. We need a more precise way to know what the user is hovering over. A better approach is to determine if the user is hovering over the top, middle, or bottom of a potential drop target.

2. The Solution: Refining the handleDragEnd Logic

We will modify the handleDragEnd function to be more intelligent. Instead of just checking if the target is a folder, we'll also check where on the target the user is dropping.

Here is the updated code for ProjectOutline.tsx. I've marked the new and changed lines for you.

Key Changes and Why They Work

Using delta from DragEndEvent: dnd-kit provides a delta object in its event, which tells you the drag distance. We can use delta.y to determine if the user dropped the item on the top or bottom half of the target element.

Item Height: I've added a targetHeight constant. You should adjust this value to be the actual pixel height of your draggable items for the best accuracy.

Refined Logic:

Now, when you drop something, the code first checks if the target is a folder.

If it is, it then checks if you dropped it on the bottom half of the folder. This is a much more reliable signal that you intend to nest the item.

If you drop on the top half of any item (folder or page), it will be treated as a reorder action, placing the dragged item before the target.

This new logic removes the ambiguity of closestCenter and provides a much more intuitive and predictable user experience. Now, your users will be able to reliably nest items by dropping them directly onto folders.
