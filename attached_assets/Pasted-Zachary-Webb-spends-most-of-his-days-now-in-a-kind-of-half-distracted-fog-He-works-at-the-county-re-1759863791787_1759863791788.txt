Zachary Webb spends most of his days now in a kind of half-distracted fog. He works at the county records office, filing papers and updating databases, but his mind wanders constantly. He's not exactly searching for his son anymore—not in the active, desperate way he did those first five years. But he hasn't stopped either. It's more like a low hum in the background of everything he does. Every dark-haired boy he sees on the street makes his chest tighten. Every phone call from an unknown number sends his heart racing before he answers.

His son, Michael, would be seventeen now. Maybe eighteen, depending on when you start counting. Zachary doesn't talk about it much anymore. People got tired of hearing about it, and he got tired of seeing that look in their eyes—the one that says they think Michael is probably dead, or that Zachary should move on already.

His wife, Claire, left him three years after Michael disappeared. They'd met in college, at some forgettable party where they'd both been standing awkwardly by the snack table. She was funny. Sharp. She made him feel like he could be someone interesting. They got married too young, probably. Had Michael too soon after that, definitely. But they were happy enough. Or they seemed to be.

After Michael vanished from the playground that Tuesday afternoon, everything between them curdled. Claire wanted to grieve. Zachary wanted to search. She accused him of refusing to accept reality. He accused her of giving up. They said terrible things to each other in the dark, things that still make him flinch when he remembers them at three in the morning.

She remarried. Lives in Oregon now, or maybe Washington. She sends him a card at Christmas sometimes. He never knows what to write back, so usually he doesn't.

Zachary keeps a box under his bed with Michael's baby clothes, school drawings, that stuffed elephant with one ear missing. Sometimes he takes things out and holds them. Sometimes he can't bring himself to open the box for months. He's fifty-two now and feels older than that. He still loves Claire, in a broken way. He still dreams about Michael coming home.
