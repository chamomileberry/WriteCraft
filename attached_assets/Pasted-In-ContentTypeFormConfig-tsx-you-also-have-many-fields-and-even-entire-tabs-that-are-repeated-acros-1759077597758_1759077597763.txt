In ContentTypeFormConfig.tsx, you also have many fields and even entire tabs that are repeated across different content types (e.g., name, description, genre, history). If you wanted to change the placeholder for every "Description" field, you'd have to find and replace it in dozens of places. This is tedious and error-prone. Instead, you could create a library of common, reusable field definitions. Then, you can easily compose your configurations while reducing boilerplate. This makes your configurations much cleaner, ensures consistency, and allows you to make site-wide changes to common fields by editing a single line of code. The options for fields like genre, rarity, and difficulty are often repeated as well. You could define these option arrays as constants and import them where needed. This guarantees consistency for your dropdown menus and makes it trivial to add or remove an option across your entire application.

For CreatureForm.tsx, you could unify the state management. The most impactful change is to manage the abilities field directly within React Hook Form instead of using a separate useState variable. Using useState for the abilitiesText creates a separate state that you have to sync manually. This prevents Zod validation errors from appearing on that field and adds extra code to your submit handler. The solution would be to make React Hook Form the single source of truth for all fields by removing the abilitiesText state variable, simplifying the handleSubmit function, refactor the "abilities" input to use the <FormField> component. This connects it to the form's state and validation. This change would simplify the component, enable automatic validation for the abilities field, and makes your code more robust and easier to maintain. You can also make your useForm call cleaner by defining the form-specific Zod schema as a separate constant and using a helper function to generate the defaultValues object. This reduces boilerplate and forgetting fields.
