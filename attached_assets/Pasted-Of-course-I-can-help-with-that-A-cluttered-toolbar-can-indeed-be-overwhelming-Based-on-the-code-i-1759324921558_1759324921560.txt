Of course, I can help with that. A cluttered toolbar can indeed be overwhelming. Based on the code in `editor-toolbar.tsx`, here are several ways to streamline your Project Editor toolbar for a cleaner and more user-friendly experience:

### 1. Group-Related Actions into Dropdowns

You can significantly reduce the number of visible buttons by grouping related actions into dropdown menus. Here are some specific suggestions:

* **Headings:** Instead of six separate buttons for H1 through H6, group them into a single "Headings" dropdown. The user can then select the desired heading level from the list.

* **Text Alignment:** The "Align Left," "Align Center," "Align Right," and "Justify" buttons are perfect candidates for a single dropdown menu.

* **Insert Menu:** You have many buttons for inserting various elements (Image, Table, Code Block, Horizontal Rule, Video, Footnote, Special Characters). Consolidate these into a single "Insert" or "+" dropdown menu. This is a very common and effective pattern in rich text editors.

### 2. Create a "More Options" Menu

For less frequently used actions, you can create a "More Options" menu (often represented by a "..." icon). This keeps the main toolbar clean while still providing access to all features.

Items that could be moved to a "More Options" menu include:

* **Print Document**
* **Focus Mode**
* **Export & Share Document**

### 3. Combine Font Styling Controls

While the font family and size are already in `Select` dropdowns, you can create a more cohesive "Font" or "Text Style" section. This could be a single dropdown that contains the selectors for family and size, as well as the color pickers for text and highlight colors.

### 4. Use Icons with Tooltips

For the buttons that remain visible on the toolbar, ensure you are using clear and universally understood icons. The use of tooltips (as you are already doing with the `title` attribute) is excellent for clarifying the function of each button on hover.

### Example Restructured Toolbar Layout

Hereâ€™s a conceptual example of how the toolbar could be reorganized:

* **Visible Buttons (High-Frequency Actions):**
    * Undo, Redo
    * Bold, Italic, Underline
    * Link
    * Bulleted List, Numbered List

* **Dropdown Menus:**
    * **Headings** (contains H1-H6)
    * **Text Alignment** (contains align options)
    * **Font** (contains font family, size, and color options)
    * **Insert** (contains Image, Table, Video, etc.)
    * **More** (...) (contains Print, Focus Mode, Export)

By implementing these changes, you can create a much cleaner and more intuitive editor toolbar for your users.
