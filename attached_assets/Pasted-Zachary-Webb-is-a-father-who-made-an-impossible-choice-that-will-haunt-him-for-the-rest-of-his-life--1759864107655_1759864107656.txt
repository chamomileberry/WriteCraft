Zachary Webb is a father who made an impossible choice that will haunt him for the rest of his life. After The Green Tide—a green initiative that went catastrophically wrong and choked the world in aggressive plant overgrowth that tore down everything humanity had built—Zach watched his son Jaxon develop abilities that terrified him. The boy could communicate with the Verdant-mutated plants, sense them somehow, even control how they grew.

Zach didn't know what to do. Neither did his wife, Rory. When the International Biotech Climate Coalition scientists in Phoenix, Arizona offered to take Jaxon into one of their nurseries, promising they could study him and other children like them to find a cure or reverse whatever was happening to them, Zach and Rory made the hardest decision of their lives. They signed away their legal guardianship. They surrendered their son.

Whether they did the right thing, whether those scientists could actually help Jaxon or if they would just use these strange children for research—Zach would never know. He lives with that uncertainty every day.

Five years have passed since then. Five years of silence from Phoenix. Five years of Zach and Rory sitting across from each other at dinner, not really talking about anything that matters. The marriage didn't survive. Not really. They're still technically together, still share the same bed in their makeshift shelter in what used to be suburban Colorado, but there's this gulf between them now. Rory blames him. She won't say it out loud, but Zach can see it in the way she looks at him—or doesn't look at him. He was the one who signed first. He was the one who said yes when the scientists asked.

Zach tells himself he's accepted it. That Jaxon is better off with people who understand what he's becoming. That trying to find him would only make things worse.

But he's lying to himself.

Three months ago, Zach started asking questions. Quiet questions. He talked to a trader who came through from the south, a woman who'd been near Phoenix. She said the IBCC facilities were locked down tight. Armed guards. No one goes in or out. No visitors. No communication with families. She said she'd heard rumors about the children—that some of them weren't children anymore. That the plants were changing them faster than anyone expected.

Zach didn't tell Rory about that conversation. He's been keeping a pack hidden under the floorboards. Dried food. Water purification tablets. A hand-drawn map with routes marked in pencil. He doesn't know if he'll actually use it. Doesn't know if he has the guts to leave, to go looking for a son who might not want to be found, who might not even remember him.

Some nights he takes the pack out and just holds it. Rory pretends to sleep. She knows. Of course she knows. Maybe she's waiting for him to go. Maybe she wants him to bring Jaxon back. Maybe she just wants to stop living in this awful in-between space where they're both drowning in guilt but too afraid to do anything about it.

Zach is tired. Tired of surviving. Tired of wondering. Tired of being the man who gave up his son and is too scared to try to fix it.

But the pack stays under the floorboards. For now.
