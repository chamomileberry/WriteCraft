It says to make a request use this code:
import { writeFile } from "fs/promises";
import Replicate from "replicate";
const replicate = new Replicate();
const input = {
    prompt: "The text \"V3 Turbo\" in the center middle. A color film-inspired portrait of a young man looking to the side with a shallow depth of field that blurs the surrounding elements, drawing attention to his eye. The fine grain and cast suggest a high ISO film stock, while the wide aperture lens creates a motion blur effect, enhancing the candid and natural documentary style.",
    aspect_ratio: "3:2"
};
const output = await replicate.run("ideogram-ai/ideogram-v3-turbo", { input });
// To access the file URL:
console.log(output.url());
//=> "https://replicate.delivery/.../output.png"
// To write the file to disk:
await writeFile("output.png", output);
//=> output.png written to disk
