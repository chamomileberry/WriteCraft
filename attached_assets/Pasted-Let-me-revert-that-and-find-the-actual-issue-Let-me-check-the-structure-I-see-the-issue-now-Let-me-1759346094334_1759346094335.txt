Let me revert that and find the actual issue. Let me check the structure:I see the issue now! Let me revert the fixed positioning and implement the correct solution. The problem is in `WorkspaceShell.tsx` - the sidebar is in the same flex row as the main content, causing the main content (and therefore the navigation) to shrink.

**The real fix**: Make the sidebar an overlay using absolute positioning instead of inline flex layout.

Here's the corrected code for `WorkspaceShell.tsx`:

```tsx
return (
  <div ref={workspaceRef} className="relative w-full min-h-screen bg-background">
    {isMobile ? (
      /* Mobile Layout - Full screen with drawer */
      <>
        {/* Full-width main content for mobile */}
        <div className="w-full min-h-screen">
          {children}
        </div>
        
        {/* Mobile Sidebar Drawer */}
        {dockedPanels.length > 0 && (
          <SidebarDrawer
            isOpen={isMobileDrawerOpen}
            onClose={closeMobileDrawer}
            title="Writing Tools"
          >
            {renderSidebarContent()}
          </SidebarDrawer>
        )}
      </>
    ) : (
      /* Desktop Layout - Full width main content with overlay sidebar */
      <>
        {/* Main Content Area - Always full width */}
        <div className="w-full min-h-screen">
          {children}
        </div>
        
        {/* Desktop Docked Sidebar - Absolute positioned overlay */}
        {dockedPanels.length > 0 && (
          <div 
            className="fixed top-0 right-0 w-96 h-screen border-l border-border bg-background z-40 overflow-y-auto shadow-lg"
            data-testid="docked-sidebar-container"
          >
            {renderSidebarContent()}
          </div>
        )}
      </>
    )}

    {/* Floating Panels */}
    <FloatingLayer />
  </div>
);
```

This way:
1. The main content always takes 100% width
2. The navigation header stays full width
3. The sidebar overlays on top of the content (fixed positioned to the right)
4. The sidebar has `z-40` to stay above content but below modals
5. It has `overflow-y-auto` so it can scroll if the content is tall

This is a cleaner UX pattern - the sidebar acts as a persistent right panel that doesn't affect the main layout.
