The Quick Notes functionality is properly implemented - the button in the Header correctly calls toggleQuickNote() from the workspace store, which creates a floating panel. However, there's a critical issue with where the floating panels are being rendered.
Root Cause
Looking at the code structure:

The Quick Notes button (Header.tsx) correctly calls toggleQuickNote() ✓
The workspace store (workspaceStore.ts) correctly creates a floating panel with mode: 'floating' ✓
The FloatingLayer component (FloatingLayer.tsx) is set up to render floating panels ✓
BUT: The FloatingLayer is only rendered inside WorkspaceLayout.tsx, which is NOT wrapping all pages

The Problem
The WorkspaceLayout component (which includes <FloatingLayer />) is only used on specific pages like the manuscript editor. When you click the Quick Notes button from other pages (like the home page, notebook page, etc.), the panel is created in the store, but there's no FloatingLayer rendered on those pages to actually display it.
Looking at App.tsx, the app structure is:
WorkspaceShell (wraps everything)
  └─ Router (pages)
      ├─ Home page (no FloatingLayer)
      ├─ Notebook page (no FloatingLayer)
      └─ Manuscript editor (has WorkspaceLayout with FloatingLayer)
The Solution
Move the <FloatingLayer /> component from WorkspaceLayout.tsx into WorkspaceShell.tsx so that floating panels (including Quick Notes) render globally across all pages, not just in the manuscript editor.
In WorkspaceShell.tsx, add the FloatingLayer import and render it at the end of the component:
tsximport { FloatingLayer } from './FloatingLayer';

// ... at the end of the WorkspaceShell return statement:
return (
  <div ref={workspaceRef} className="relative w-full min-h-screen bg-background">
    {/* ... existing mobile/desktop layout code ... */}
    
    {/* Add FloatingLayer here to render globally */}
    <FloatingLayer />
  </div>
);
This will ensure that when you click the Quick Notes button from any page, the floating panel will actually appear on screen.
