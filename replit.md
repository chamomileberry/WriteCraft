## System Architecture

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with a custom design system
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives (shadcn/ui) for accessibility
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state, Zustand for client state
- **Routing**: Wouter
- **Build Tool**: Vite

### Backend
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints
- **Content Generation**: Server-side algorithms for creative writing content.

### Data Storage
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Neon serverless)
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM
- **Schema**: Tables for users, generated content, guides, and user collections.

### Design System & Theming
- **Color Palette**: Professional writer-focused colors (purple primary, teal secondary, orange accents)
- **Theming**: Dark/Light mode with CSS custom properties
- **Typography**: Hierarchical font sizing with serif headings and sans-serif body text.

### Key Features
- **Authentication**: Replit Auth integration (Google, GitHub, X, Apple, email/password) with PostgreSQL-backed sessions.
- **Account Management**: User profiles and secure access control.
- **Content Management**:
    - **Notebook System**: User-created notebooks for organizing worldbuilding content with responsive display.
    - **Generator System**: Modular content generation (characters, plots, settings, names, conflicts, themes, moods).
    - **Writing Guides**: Structured educational content with categories and search, featuring admin-only management.
    - **Hierarchical Project System**: Project management with unlimited folder nesting, pages (sections), rich text editor (TipTap), auto-save, media insertion, and export capabilities.
    - **Enhanced Character Editor**: Responsive sidebar navigation for character details.
    - **AI-Powered Inline Editing**: Grammarly-style AI assistance integrated across all text editors, offering actions like improving, shortening, expanding, fixing grammar, and suggestions using Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet.
    - **Writing Assistant Panel**: Conversational AI assistant for analyzing text, proofreading, generating questions, and providing writing feedback.
    - **AI Writing Style**: All AI features adhere to comprehensive anti-cliché guidelines to produce human-like, authentic, and expressive writing, avoiding robotic patterns and forbidden phrases.

### Security & Authorization
- **Multi-Layer Security Architecture**: Enterprise-grade security implementation protecting against major web vulnerabilities.
- **Security Layers**: Input Sanitization (SQLi, XSS, Prototype Pollution), Authentication & Access Control, Rate Limiting, Admin Privilege Protection, Row-Level Security (RLS), CSRF Protection, Security Headers, and Security Audit Logging.
- **Ownership Validation Pattern**: All content operations enforce strict ownership validation using a "Fetch → Validate → Execute" pattern.
- **Critical Security Rules**: Delete/update operations validate ownership, triple-filter for multi-tenant isolation, and return 404 for unauthorized access to prevent information disclosure.

### Collaboration & Sharing System
- **Multi-User Collaboration**: Comprehensive sharing system enabling co-authors, writing groups, and mentors/students to collaborate on notebooks and projects with granular permission controls.
- **Permission Levels**: View, Comment (future), Edit.
- **Share Management**: User search, ShareDialog component for managing collaborators, and integrated share buttons.
- **Security & Access Control**: RLS middleware validates ownership first, then checks shares table for collaborative access. Unauthorized access returns 404.
